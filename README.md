# *ros2-urdf-playground*
Welcome to the ROS2 URDF Workflow repository! This repository showcases how to create a visual representation of some robot in URDF format. This will come in handy if someone wants to have a real robot and want to use the ROS infrastructure. Before working on real robot, visual representation is used to develop the various algorithms for different use case scenarios.
